# JavaScript Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to loose comparison using the '===' operator.  The function `foo` exhibits unexpected behavior due to the way JavaScript handles null and undefined values. The issue arises from implicit type coercion.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function intends to perform conditional checks based on the input value `x`. However, the comparison `x === null` may not function as intended. JavaScript's loose equality (==) may lead to unexpected results when comparing numbers with null or undefined.  This can result in an incorrect return value under certain conditions.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` in your preferred JavaScript environment.
3. Run the code. Observe the output.

## Solution

The solution involves handling null and undefined values explicitly using strict equality (`===`) or leveraging optional chaining or nullish coalescing.

## Note

This example highlights the importance of understanding JavaScript's type system and the potential pitfalls of using loose comparison operators.  Always use explicit null and undefined checks to avoid unexpected behavior.
